# Serverless Video Conferencing App <img src="https://github.com/prateek332/VideoConferencing/blob/main/src/assets/icons/logo.svg" width="65" align="center" />

### Ever used google meet? ms-teams? webex? zoom? whatsapp video call? You see where I'm going with this?
### Try the hosted app by clicking [here](https://prateekvideochat.web.app)
### The outstanding feature about this app is that this app doesn't require any server setup to make it work. Yes you heard it right, also it's given in the name ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### - To get started, create a new firebase project at [firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and initialize firestore in test mode (you can change this in production but for while developing test mode is fine)
### - After that you can clone this repo, replace my firebase configurations with yours in [`app.config.ts`](https://github.com/prateek332/VideoConferencing/blob/main/src/app.config.ts) file and run these commands inside root folder of the project: -
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
